## **1. Introduction**

The main objective of this guide is to guide you in the use of the various
functionalities offered by Pytank. Throughout this document, it will detail the
key concepts that will allow you to perform an analysis of your data by applying
reservoir engineering. From basic definitions, such as that of a well, to the
implementation of different aquifer models, we will provide you with the
necessary tools to obtain more accurate results on the behavior of your data.

## **2. Installation**
