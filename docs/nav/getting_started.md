## **Our Philosophy**

Pytank is a **Python** library for oil reserves
estimation developed under a philosophy that promotes accessibility, innovation
and sustainability. As an open source tool, it seeks to democratize knowledge
and foster collaboration between researchers, students and professionals in the
energy sector, eliminating economic barriers.

The project focuses on simplifying and automating the reserves estimation
process using the material balance method, allowing users to optimize their
operations without the need for significant investments in commercial software.
In addition, by improving estimation accuracy, it contributes to more
sustainable practices, reducing the environmental impact of unnecessary
drilling.
